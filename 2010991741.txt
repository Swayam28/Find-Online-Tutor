ABSTRACT

This project presents the development of an online tutoring platform that leverages the power of modern web technologies to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and secure educational service.
 The platform utilizes ReactJS as the front-end framework, NodeJS and ExpressJS as the back-end infrastructure, and MySQL as the database system. The platform's main features include student and tutor registration, a searchable database of tutors.
The platform has the potential to impact a diverse user base, from K-12 students to adult learners, and from tutors in various subjects and languages to parents seeking academic support for their children. The project provides a solid foundation for future expansion and innovation in the online education space.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, the field of education has witnessed a significant shift towards online learning and digital technologies. With the advent of the internet and the proliferation of web-based tools and platforms, more and more students are turning to online resources for academic support, instruction, and interaction.
In response to this trend, I embarked on a project to develop an online tutoring platform that provides students with access to qualified and experienced tutors in a virtual environment. The platform was designed to be user-friendly, efficient, and secure.
To achieve this goal, I utilized a range of cutting-edge technologies, including ReactJS for the front-end, NodeJS and ExpressJS for the back-end, and MySQL for the database.
The platform's user base includes students from various levels of education, from K-12 to post-secondary, as well as tutors from a variety of fields and specializations.
